MIDI::Realtime is a Perl module that allows you to write directly
to a MIDI device.  Enhancements are planned to allow it to read
MIDI too, among other things.

See http://www.slab.org/void/music/ for an example of how I'm 
using this module.  MIDI::Realtime is a simple piece of code, but 
it provides wide scope for experimentation with music and sounds.
I'm having a lot of fun with it, anyway :)

PREREQUISITES

This is new software.  I have only tested it with OSS/Free, under
GNU/Linux (redhat 6.0 and 6.1).  I'm very interested to hear of 
any more success stories.

It requires sys/soundcard.ph to be present.

INSTALLATION

You install MIDI::Realtime, as you would install any perl module 
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of MIDI::Realtime in your home
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

  perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/perl
  
DOCUMENTATION

See perldoc MIDI::Realtime for description of the methods within, and
a couple of simple examples of their use.
